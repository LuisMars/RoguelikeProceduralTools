# Roguelike Procedural Tools

**Roguelike Procedural Tools** is a collection of web-based utilities aimed at simplifying the creation of roguelike games. This project is designed to assist developers with procedurally generated content, including dungeon layouts and replacement rules, to enhance game design workflows. 

Currently, this project is a **work in progress**, with tools actively being developed and refined. Feedback and suggestions are welcome to make the tools as useful as possible for the game development community.

## Tools

### [Rule Replacement Tool](https://tools.luismars.com/rules)

This tool allows developers to design and manage procedural replacement rules for tile-based games. 

- **Two-Grid System**:
  - A **reference grid** to define patterns or arrangements for identification.
  - A **replacement grid** to specify configurations for how tiles should change.
- **Advanced Features**: Supports rotation, mirroring, and other customization options for complex rules.
- **Export as JSON**: Seamlessly integrate the generated rules into your gameâ€™s procedural generation systems.

### [Cyclic Dungeon Generator](https://tools.luismars.com/cycles)

Inspired by techniques used in roguelikes such as [Unexplored](https://www.boristhebrave.com/2021/04/10/dungeon-generation-in-unexplored/), this tool focuses on creating dungeon layouts with cyclic paths for improved replayability and spatial complexity.

- **Cyclic Path Design**: Create intricate dungeon layouts featuring loops and branching paths.
- **Live Preview**: Visualize dungeon structures in real time with **Mermaid diagrams**.
- **JSON Export**: Save and integrate your dungeon data directly into your development pipeline.
